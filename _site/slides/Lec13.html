## A bridge between `R` and JavaScript

-  JavaScript enables web developers to create __client-side__ web applications

  - Computations are happening __in the client's browser__, instead of the host's web servers
  
- `D3` (or `D3.js`) is the most popular JavaScript library for client-side dynamic data visualizations

  - `D3` == 'data-driven documents'

--

- RStudio developers created the [`htmlwidgets`](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/index.html) enabling `R` users to use `D3` without needing to learn JavaScript!

- Renders data visualizations in HTML using `D3` wrappers

  - [Incredible gallery with a variety of uses](http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/), including a chess package called [`rchess`](http://jkunst.com/rchess/)!

## [Leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/): interactive HTML maps

.pull-left[


```r
cmu &lt;- 
  tibble(address = "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA") %&gt;%
* tidygeocoder::geocode(address, method = "osm")

library(leaflet)
*leaflet() %&gt;% addTiles() %&gt;%
* addMarkers(data = cmu)
```

- `addTiles()`: builds layer with static map (default from OpenStreetMap)

- `addMarkers()`: add marker at point location, e.g., CMU

- Use [`tidygeocoder`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidygeocoder/vignettes/tidygeocoder.html) for spatial queries

## Interactive plots with [Plotly](https://plotly.com/r/)

- Start with an initial plain plot


```r

  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, 
             color = species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  labs(x = "Body Mass (g)", y = "Bill Length (mm)") +
  theme_bw()

## Interactive plots with [Plotly](https://plotly.com/r/)

.pull-left[

- Make it interactive with `ggplotly`


```r
library(plotly)
ggplotly(scatter_plain)
```

- `plotly` has its own plotting syntax, but we can just use `ggplot2` instead 

  - there will be some annoying differences at times, so just be careful
  
- Several ways to interact: filter, zoom, and view additional info by hovering over the points with tooltip...

## Customize the tooltip

.pull-left[

- Update to include `text` with penguin's `sex`


```r
scatter_upd &lt;- penguins %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm, 
             color = species,
*            text = paste("sex:", sex))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2) +
  labs(x = "Body Mass (g)", y = "Bill Length (mm)") +
  theme_bw()

ggplotly(scatter_upd, 
*        tooltip = c("text", "species"))
```

- We can specify what is included in the tooltip when hovering over the points

# Putting it all together with dashboards

- Dashboards are popular way to make data and visualizations available to clients, managers, stakeholders, etc. to help with decision making

- Typically include a mix of graphics and text, depending on the context 

--

- Can easily make HTML dashboards using the [`flexdashboard`](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) package

  - Provide interactive capabilities within an HTML file (i.e., you can email this!)
  
  - __These are NOT fully interactive like Shiny apps__
  
  - [You can use Shiny within `flexdashboard`](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/articles/shiny.html) but it requires a Shiny server
  
  - Another option is [`shinydashboard`](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/)
  
- Outside of `R`, [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) is a popular tool (can use free Tableau Public version)

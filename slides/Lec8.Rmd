# Conceptual review

Last class: contour plots, heat maps, and diving into high-dimensional data

#### Today: how do we visualize structure of high-dimensional data?

- Example: What if I give you a dataset with 50 variables, and ask you to make __one visualization__ that best represents the data? _What do you do?_

--

- Do NOT panic and make $\binom{50}{2} = 1225$ pairs of plots!

- __Intuition__: Take high-dimensional data and __represent it in 2-3 dimensions__, then visualize those dimensions

---

## Thinking about distance...

When describing visuals, we've implicitly "clustered" observations together

- e.g., where are the mode(s) in the data?

--

These types of task require characterizing the __distance__ between observations

- Clusters: groups of observations that are "close" together

--

This is easy to do for 2 quantitative variables: just make a scatterplot (possibly with contours or heatmap)

#### But how do we define "distance" for high-dimensional data?

--

Let $\boldsymbol{x}_i = (x_{i1}, \dots, x_{ip})$ be a vector of $p$ features for observation $i$

Question of interest: How "far away" is $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ from $\boldsymbol{x}_j$?

--

When looking at a scatterplot, you're using __Euclidean distance__ (length of the line in $p$-dimensional space):

$$d(\boldsymbol{x}_i, \boldsymbol{x}_j) = \sqrt{(x_{i1} - x_{j1})^2 + \dots + (x_{ip} - x_{jp})^2}$$

---

## Distances in general

There's a variety of different types of distance metrics: [Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry), [Mahalanobis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance), [Cosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity), [Kullback-Leiber Divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence), [Wasserstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasserstein_metric), but we're just going to focus on [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance)

--

$d(\boldsymbol{x}_i, \boldsymbol{x}_j)$ measures pairwise distance between two observations $i,j$ and has the following properties:

1. __Identity__: $\boldsymbol{x}_i = \boldsymbol{x}_j \iff d(\boldsymbol{x}_i, \boldsymbol{x}_j) = 0$

2. __Non-Negativity__: $d(\boldsymbol{x}_i, \boldsymbol{x}_j) \geq 0$

3. __Symmetry__: $d(\boldsymbol{x}_i, \boldsymbol{x}_j) = d(\boldsymbol{x}_j, \boldsymbol{x}_i)$

4. __Triange Inequality__: $d(\boldsymbol{x}_i, \boldsymbol{x}_j) \leq d(\boldsymbol{x}_i, \boldsymbol{x}_k) + d(\boldsymbol{x}_k, \boldsymbol{x}_j)$

--

.pull-left[

__Distance Matrix__: matrix $D$ of all pairwise distances

- $D_{ij} = d(\boldsymbol{x}_i, \boldsymbol{x}_j)$

- where $D_{ii} = 0$ and $D_{ij} = D_{ji}$

]
.pull-right[

$$D = \begin{pmatrix}
                0 & D_{12} & \cdots & D_{1n} \\
                D_{21} & 0 & \cdots & D_{2n} \\
                \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
                D_{n1} & \cdots & \cdots & 0
            \end{pmatrix}$$

]

---

## Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS)

#### General approach for visualizing distance matrices

- Puts $n$ observations in a $k$-dimensional space such that the distances are preserved as much as possible

  - where $k << p$ typically choose $k = 2$
  
--

MDS attempts to create new point $\boldsymbol{y}_i = (y_{i1}, y_{i2})$ for each unit such that:

$$\sqrt{(y_{i1} - y_{j1})^2 + (y_{i2} - y_{j2})^2} \approx D_{ij}$$

- i.e., distance in 2D MDS world is approximately equal to the actual distance

--

#### Then plot the new $\boldsymbol{y}$s on a scatterplot

- Use the `scale()` function to ensure variables are comparable

- Make a distance matrix for this dataset

- Visualize it with MDS

---

## MDS example with Starbucks drinks

```{r starbucks-mds, eval = FALSE}
starbucks_scaled_quant_data <- starbucks %>%
  dplyr::select(serv_size_m_l:caffeine_mg) %>%
  scale(center = FALSE, 
        scale = apply(., 2, sd, na.rm = TRUE)) #<<

dist_euc <- dist(starbucks_scaled_quant_data) #<<

starbucks_mds <- cmdscale(d = dist_euc, k = 2) #<<

starbucks <- starbucks %>%
  mutate(mds1 = starbucks_mds[,1],
         mds2 = starbucks_mds[,2])

starbucks %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mds1, y = mds2)) +

## Dimension reduction - searching for variance

__GOAL__: Focus on reducing dimensionality of feature space, i.e., number of columns, while __retaining__ most of the information, i.e., __variance__, in a lower dimensional space

- $n \times p$ matrix $\rightarrow$ dimension reduction technique $\rightarrow$ $n \times k$ matrix

--

Special case we just discussed: __MDS__

- $n \times n$ __distance__ matrix $\rightarrow$ MDS $\rightarrow$ $n \times k$ matrix (usually $k = 2$)

--

- This requires converting data into a distance matrix - summarizing all differences between observations into a single number, effectively "double reduction"

1. Reduce data to a distance matrix

2. Reduce distance matrix to $k = 2$ dimensions

#### How can we apply dimension to the original data?

---

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
& & \text{really} & & \\
& & \text{wide} & & \\
& & \text{matrix} & &
\end{pmatrix}
\rightarrow \text{matrix algebra stuff} \rightarrow 
\begin{pmatrix}
\text{much}  \\
\text{thinner}  \\
\text{matrix} 
\end{pmatrix}
$$

- Start with $n \times p$ matrix of __correlated__ variables $\rightarrow$ $n \times k$ matrix of __uncorrelated__ variables

--

- Each of the $k$ columns in the right-hand matrix are __principal components__, all uncorrelated with each other

- First column accounts for most variation in the data, second column for second-most variation, and so on

#### Intuition: first few principal components account for most of the variation in the data

---

## What are principal components?

- Assume $\boldsymbol{X}$ is a $n \times p$ matrix that is __centered__ and __stardardized__

- _Total variation_ $= p$, since Var( $\boldsymbol{x}_j$ ) = 1 for all $j = 1, \dots, p$

- PCA will give us $p$ principal components that are $n$-length columns - call these $Z_1, \dots, Z_p$

--

__First principal component__ (aka PC1):

$$Z_1 = \phi_{11} X_1 + \phi_{21} X_2 + \dots + \phi_{p1} X_p$$


--

  - $\phi_{j1}$ are the weights indicating the contributions of each variable $j \in 1, \dots, p$
  
  - Weights are normalized $\sum_{j=1}^p \phi_{j1}^2 = 1$
  
  - $\phi_{1} = (\phi_{11}, \phi_{21}, \dots, \phi_{p1})$ is the __loading vector__ for PC1

--
  
  - $Z_1$ is a linear combination of the $p$ variables that has the __largest variance__

---

## What are principal components?

__Second principal component__:

$$Z_2 = \phi_{12} X_1 + \phi_{22} X_2 + \dots + \phi_{p2} X_p$$

  - $\phi_{j2}$ are the weights indicating the contributions of each variable $j \in 1, \dots, p$
  
  - Weights are normalized $\sum_{j=1}^p \phi_{j1}^2 = 1$
  
  - $\phi_{2} = (\phi_{12}, \phi_{22}, \dots, \phi_{p2})$ is the __loading vector__ for PC2
  
  - $Z_2$ is a linear combination of the $p$ variables that has the __largest variance__
  
    - __Subject to constraint it is uncorrelated with $Z_1$__ 

--

We repeat this process to create $p$ principal components

- __Uncorrelated__: Each ($Z_j, Z_{j'}$) is uncorrelated with each other

- __Ordered Variance__: Var( $Z_1$ ) $>$ Var( $Z_2$ ) $> \dots >$ Var( $Z_p$ )

- __Total Variance__: $\sum_{j=1}^p \text{Var}(Z_j) = p$


#### Intuition: pick some $k << p$ such that if $\sum_{j=1}^k \text{Var}(Z_j) \approx p$, then just using $Z_1, \dots, Z_k$

## So what do we do with the principal components?

__The point__: given a dataset with $p$ variables, we can find $k$ variables $(k << p)$ that account for most of the variation in the data

--

Note that the principal components are NOT easy to interpret - these are combinations of all variables

PCA is similar to MDS with these main differences:

1. MDS reduces a _distance_ matrix while PCA reduces a _data_ matrix

2. PCA has a principled way to choose $k$

3. Can visualize how the principal components are related to variables in data

---

## Working with PCA on Starbucks drinks

Use the `prcomp()` function (based on SVD) for PCA on __centered__ and __scaled__ data

```{r}
starbucks_pca <- prcomp(dplyr::select(starbucks, serv_size_m_l:caffeine_mg), #<<
                        center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE) #<<
summary(starbucks_pca)
```

---

## Computing Principal Components

Extract the matrix of principal components $\boldsymbol{Z} = XV$ (dimension of $\boldsymbol{Z}$ will match original data)

```{r}
starbucks_pc_matrix <- starbucks_pca$x
head(starbucks_pc_matrix)
```

Columns are uncorrelated, such that Var( $Z_1$ ) $>$ Var( $Z_2$ ) $> \dots >$ Var( $Z_p$ ) - can start with a scatterplot of $Z_1, Z_2$

---

## Starbucks drinks: PC1 and PC2

.pull-left[
```{r pca-plot, eval = FALSE}
starbucks <- starbucks %>%
  mutate(pc1 = starbucks_pc_matrix[,1], 
         pc2 = starbucks_pc_matrix[,2])
starbucks %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pc1, y = pc2)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "PC 1", y = "PC 2")
```

- __Look familiar?__

- Principal components are not interpretable, but we can add a __biplot__ with arrows showing the linear relationship between one variable and other variables

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label="pca-plot", echo = FALSE, fig.height=7}
```

---

## Making PCs interpretable with biplots ([`factoextra`](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/factoextra-r-package-easy-multivariate-data-analyses-and-elegant-visualization))

.pull-left[


```{r pca-biplot, eval = FALSE}
library(factoextra)
# Designate to only label the variables:
fviz_pca_biplot( #<<
  starbucks_pca, label = "var", #<<
  # Change the alpha for observations 
  # which is represented by ind
  alpha.ind = .25,
  # Modify the alpha for variables (var):
  alpha.var = .75,
  col.var = "darkblue")
```

- Arrow direction: "as the variable increases..."

- Arrow angles: correlation

  - 90 degrees means uncorrelated
  - $< 90$ means positively correlated
  - $> 90$ means negatively correlated
  
- Arrow length: strength of relationship with PCs

]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "pca-biplot", echo = FALSE, fig.height=8}

```

]

---

## How many principal components to use?

#### Intuition: Additional principal components will add smaller and smaller variance

- Keep adding components until the added variance _drops off_

```{r}
summary(starbucks_pca)
```

---

## Create scree plot (aka "elbow plot") to choose

```{r scree-plot, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width="80%"}
fviz_eig(starbucks_pca, addlabels = TRUE) + #<<
  geom_hline(yintercept = 100 * (1 / ncol(starbucks_pca$x)), linetype = "dashed", color = "darkred")
```

- Number of dimensions on x-axis, proportion of variance on y-axis

- _Rule of thumb_: horizontal line at $1/p$ (__Why?__)

---

## Nonlinear dimension reduction, e.g., t-SNE


```{r tsne-plot, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(Rtsne)
set.seed(2013)
tsne_drinks <- Rtsne::Rtsne(starbucks_scaled_quant_data, dims = 2,
                            check_duplicates = FALSE)

starbucks %>%
  mutate(tsne1 = tsne_drinks$Y[,1], 
         tsne2 = tsne_drinks$Y[,2]) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = tsne1, y = tsne2, color = size)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "t-SNE 1", y = "t-SNE 2")

```

## PCA: [__singular value decomposition (SVD)__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition)

$$
X = U D V^T
$$

- Matrices $U$ and $V$ contain the left and right (respectively) __singular vectors of scaled matrix $X$__

- $D$ is the diagonal matrix of the __singular values__

--

- SVD simplifies matrix-vector multiplication as __rotate, scale, and rotate again__


--
$V$ is called the __loading matrix__ for $X$ with $\phi_{j}$ as columns, 

  - $Z = X  V$ is the PC matrix

--

BONUS __eigenvalue decomposition__ (aka spectral decomposition)

- $V$ are the __eigenvectors__ of $X^TX$ (covariance matrix, $^T$ means _transpose_)

- $U$ are the __eigenvectors__ of $XX^T$

- The singular values (diagonal of $D$) are square roots of the __eigenvalues__ of $X^TX$ or $XX^T$

- Meaning that $Z = UD$

---

## Eigenvalues guide dimension reduction

We want to choose $p^* < p$ such that we are explaining variation in the data

--

Eigenvalues $\lambda_j$ for $j \in 1, \dots, p$ indicate __the variance explained by each component__

  - $\sum_j^p \lambda_j = p$, meaning $\lambda_j \geq 1$ indicates $\text{PC}j$ contains at least one variable's worth in variability
  
  - $\lambda_j / p$ equals proportion of variance explained by $\text{PC}j$
  
  - Arranged in descending order so that $\lambda_1$ is largest eigenvalue and corresponds to PC1
  
--
  
  - Can compute the cumulative proportion of variance explained (CVE) with $p^*$ components:
  
$$\text{CVE}_{p^*} = \frac{\sum_j^{p*} \lambda_j}{p}$$

Can use [__scree plot__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scree_plot) to plot eigenvalues and guide choice for $p^* <p$ by looking for "elbow" (rapid to slow change)
